# Data-structure-and-Algorithms-Course

This course teaches how to measure an algorithm's efficiency and organize data using fundamental structures like arrays and linked lists. It then covers essential algorithms for tasks such as sorting information and finding specific elements without searching the entire collection. The lessons progress to advanced hierarchical data structures, including trees for ordered data and graphs for modeling networks. Ultimately, these tools are used to solve complex optimization problems, such as finding the most efficient path through a network
