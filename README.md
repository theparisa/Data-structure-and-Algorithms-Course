## Foundations of Algorithm Analysis

This section covers the basics of how to measure an algorithm's performance using asymptotic notations like Big O to describe its efficiency. It also introduces recursion, a key problem-solving technique where a function calls itself to break a problem down into smaller parts.

**Key Algorithms and Concepts Covered:**
* **_Algorithm Complexity & Analysis_**
* **_Asymptotic Notations (Big O, Omega, Theta)_**
* **_Runtime Analysis_**
* **_Recursive Algorithms_**


## Core Data Structures

This section introduces fundamental ways to store and organize data, including linear structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists. It also covers hash tables, a powerful structure that uses a hash function for fast average-time data lookups.

**Key Algorithms and Concepts Covered:**
* **_Abstract Data Types (ADT)_**
* **_Memory Management_**
* **_Arrays_**
* **_Stacks_**
* **_Queues_**
* **_Linked Lists_**
* **_Hash Tables_**

## Sorting and Selection Algorithms

This part covers various algorithms for arranging data in a specific order, from simple methods to efficient divide-and-conquer strategies like Merge Sort and Quick Sort. It also addresses the selection problem, which focuses on finding the k-th smallest element efficiently.

**Key Algorithms and Concepts Covered:**
* **_Bubble, Insertion, & Selection Sort_**
* **_Merge Sort_**
* **_Quick Sort_**
* **_Counting, Radix, & Bucket Sort_**
* **_K-th Selection Algorithm_**


## Tree-Based Data Structures

This section explores tree data structures, which are used to represent hierarchical information and enable efficient operations. Key topics include binary trees, heaps for priority management, and self-balancing search trees (AVL, Red-Black) that maintain fast search times.

**Key Algorithms and Concepts Covered:**
* **_Binary Trees_**
* **_Expression Trees_**
* **_Huffman Trees_**
* **_Binary Heap_**
* **_Binary Search Trees (BST)_**
* **_Self-Balancing Trees (AVL & Red-Black)_**


## Graph Algorithms

This final section focuses on graphs, which model networks and complex relationships between entities. It covers essential traversal methods (BFS, DFS) and key optimization problems like finding the Minimum Spanning Tree and the shortest paths between vertices.

**Key Algorithms and Concepts Covered:**
* **_Graph Representation & Traversal (BFS, DFS)_**
* **_Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)_**
* **_Connected Components_**
* **_Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)_**
* **_Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP)_**
* **_All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)_**
